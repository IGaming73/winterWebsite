                It's the most magical moment of the year! Snow is falling, the houses are lit up, and the presents are on their way!
                I hope you well behaved this year, because the presents this winter will be amazing!
                All my elves did some good work this winter, and the presents are packed up and redy to be delivered all around the world!

                "But, who are you?" you might ask! Well, it's the one and only! Santa! And I learned that you well behaved this year!
                So this Cristmas night, I will enter by you chimney, and put the presents right where they belong, at the Christmas tree!
                But don't forget, I'm a picky eater! You can leave some cookies if you want, so I can get some more energy for the delivery.
                And don't forget the carrots for my reindeer too, Rudolph loves carrots!
